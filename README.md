# CatClassifier

This repo constains a Hugging Face repo that classifies cat images to their breed

The model used was trained by scrapping images from Duck Duck Go into a pkl file that can be found at: https://huggingface.co/spaces/abbyblancett/catclass/tree/main

The model acheives 99% accuracy on large datasets. The Hugging Face GUI allows users to input their own cats into the image for them to be classified as well.
